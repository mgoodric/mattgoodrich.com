T&T Customs had a grand re-opening a few weeks ago at the headquarters in Cheyenne Wyoming.  Since it was only a short drive from Fort Collins, I figured I would drop by for a few hours. There were several rigs built by T&T and several rigs that just showed up for the show.

I entered my jeep in the show for a few hours while I was there, but I did leave early so I never heard which rig won.  My rig is close enough to stock that I know it surely wasnt me.

Here are some pictures that I took while I was there.
