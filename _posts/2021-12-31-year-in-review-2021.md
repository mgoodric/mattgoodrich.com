When thinking about what I am going to write, these posts always sound better in my head. Having read several year in review posts myself over the last week, I have gone back and forth between covering the big things that happened in each month, using data from the various things I did throughout the year, or just something else entirely. I decided to go with a mixture of data and some of the high points throughout the year.

This year started out like most years - a resolution to be more healthy and lose weight - and it turns out like every prior year that did not actually happen. What did make this year different however is that I was leading several groups within an Information Security team, instead of being deeply focused on the technical details I have been previously. As the Director of Security Architecture, my team and I were focused on enterprise/cloud/product security architecture and maturing our application security program. What I was most focused on however was being a better business partner; making sure less slipped through the cracks, and reducing the amount of time it took for us to respond to requests.

This is a major step in a journey I started 18 years earlier when I first logged time in a Cessna 150 (N11518) on July 26, 2003 at Ryan Field (KRYN) in Tucson, Arizona. On February 2nd, 2021 I passed my checkride in a Cessna 172 (N523AB) at Erie Metropolitan Airport (KEIK) in Erie, Colorado. Since then, I have taken my family on several flights, and have myself visited several airports in the central and western United States, taken a mountain flying course, received my high performance endorsement, bought into a partnership of a Cessna 182 (N5788J) at Centennial Airport (KAPA), and sold my share of the partnership. Going into 2022, I am a few hours into my Instrument rating, and plan to get it wrapped up in early 2022. I flew for a total of 67.5 hours in 2021.

At the beginning of May my family welcomed home its' newest addition "Coco". I became a father to a beautiful daughter, and was on leave from work for 3 months thanks to the benefits provided by Alteryx. I was happy to have the time - I had only one week with our previous kiddo - but the longest I had not worked since I was 14 years old was 3 weeks. We had big ambitions and tight timelines at work... I definitely had FOMO prior to going out on leave, but that quickly went away. In sort of an unplanned drive, I decided to do some learning while I was out. Many of the mentors, peers, and leaders I have learned the most from in the past are avid readers and always have a number of recommendations. I read more in 2021, than I had in any previous year. Not something I am actually super proud of - but I definitely understand the love of books my wife has a little bit more now (for the record she read over 100 books this year). Here is what I read (or listened to):

* Oh Crap! Potty Training: Everything Modern Parents Need to Know to Do It Once and Do It Right - Jamie Glowacki
* The Five Dysfunctions of a Team: A Leadership Fable - Patrick Lencioni
* An Elegant Puzzle: Systems of Engineering Management - Will Larson
* Turn the Ship Around: A True Story of Turning Followers into Leaders - L. David Marquet
* Extreme Ownership - Jocko Willink & Leif Babin
* Staff Engineer: Leadership Beyond the Management Track - Will Larson
* The Managers Path: A Guide for Tech Leaders Navigating Growth and Change - Camille Fournier 
* Death by Meeting - Patrick Lencioni
* The Kubernetes Book - Nigel Poulton
* This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends: The Cyberweapons Arms Race - Nicole Perlroth
* Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility - Patty McCord
* Rich Dad Poor Dad: What the Rich Teach Their Kids About Money That the and Middle Class Do Not! - Robert Kiyosaki
* Kitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly - Anthony Bourdain

I had another 8-10 books that I started, but did not make it through them yet.

After returning from leave, the latter half of the year has come with a number of changes.
* I transitioned back into the Alteryx Engineering organization, and am building out a new team focused on DevSecOps
![image-center](/assets/images/3280.jpg){: .align-center}
* We sold our home in Denver
* We welcomed our first au pair to the family

* We moved our family across the country and bought a home in Poulsbo, Washington

We're still getting settled, and though we have moved almost a dozen times in the past decade, doing it with two kids is A LOT more work than it has been previously. 

Looking forward to 2022, here are some more realistic things I would like to accomplish:
* Continue posting on mattgoodrich.com & improve my writing skills
* Complete my Instrument Rating
* Read at least as many books as I did this year
* Keep my family healthy and safe

Stretch goals:
* Buy a new (to me) airplane
* Actually take our scheduled vacation to Maui in February
