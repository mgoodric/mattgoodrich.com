We ran Moody Hill and Crystal Mountain yesterday, just west of Fort Collins. It gave me a chance to try out my new 35" MT/Rs.

This video is of the first rock wall obstacle on Moody Hill. I stalled 3 times! It was one of the places where I need 3 feet.

This video is of the lower obstacle at the Quary on Moody Hill. I tried to mount this obstacle last year on my stock tires, and couldn't do it. I succeeded this time however.
