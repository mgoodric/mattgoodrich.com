Hi There!

## Professional Life
Currently I am the Director of Product Security at Alteryx. During my time at Alteryx I have also served as:

I have spent most of my career in either security or software, and have bounced back and forth between industry and consulting. I tend to find I am happiest when I can combine my love of building something (products, software, infrastructure) and security; Application Security/Product Security, DevSecOps are my jam.

Aspirationally, I am curently focused on the path to becoming a Chief Product Security Office (CPSO).

## Personal Life
